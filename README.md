LCARS (Library Computer Access Retrieval System)

I'm recreating a LCARS website system that I created many years ago. It was a very large jQuery plugin. I think I'm just going to create a CSS system. Something much like that of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/), [Brick](http://mozilla.github.io/brick/index.html), or [Pure](http://purecss.io/).

I'm not exactly sure what tech I'll be building this off of. Right now I'm looking hard at [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) with [Nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib), [Jeet](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet), [Rupture](https://github.com/jenius/rupture), and [Typographic](https://github.com/corysimmons/typographic).

More to come.
